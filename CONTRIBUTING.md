Thank you for your interest in contributing to Motion UI Kit.

Guidelines

- Keep PRs small and focused (one visual or functional change per PR).
- Run `npm run format` before submitting a PR.
- For new components, include a demo in `src/pages` and a simple smoke test under `src/__tests__`.

If you're unsure about API changes, open an issue first to discuss.

Thanks!
